<h1>Score Chart</h1>

<p>Calculating the score of a hand in riichi mahjong is very difficult and counters in many different factors. The most important factor, however, are how many conditions your hand fulfills. Below are a list of the existing conditions in a conventional riichi mahjong game, their description, how much they are worth, and how likely you are to be able to complete the condition. Note that some conditions lose their worth if the hand is revealed before completion, for which the worth before the reveal and the worth after are separated by a slash in the chart.</p>
